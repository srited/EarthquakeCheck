 The USGS is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment; and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.

The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes. Visit the USGS GeoJSON Feed.
 
 Two Solutions has been given in this.
 First Solution is under Solutions Folder thet has the following featues :
 - > Developed using React.
 - > Implemented React Hooks
 - > Used GlobalFetch to fetch API data.
 - > Used Material UI datagrid and Header
 - > Implemented separate components that helps in reusing.
 - > Implemented Marquee in the screen to know the statistics.
 - > The grid can be viewed based on the MAgnitude selected from the dropdown.
 - > Data is differentiated using various colors based on the severity of the magnitude.
 - > Statistics of the earthquake data is displayed.
 - > The grid gets refreshed automatically with the new data every 10 seconds.
 - > Last sync date and time can be viewed at the end of the screen.

Second solution is under the Visualisation Folder
- > Created using JS,Leaflet.js,d3.
- > Created a map using Leaflet.js that plots all of the earthquakes from data set based on their longitude and latitude.
- > Data markers reflects the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger and darker in color.
- > Included popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.
- > Create a legend that will provide context for your map data.
